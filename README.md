# Simulate Risk Limiting Audits

The Colorado Secretary of State (Jena Griswold) did an excellent
job getting ahead of rubbish conspiracy theories about voting
and election denial in 2020.

Part of the success of vote-by-mail in Colorado is that Colorado
does "Risk-limiting Audits" of ballots.
State of Colorado mails every eligible voter a paper ballot
that you mark by hand.
The ballot is both human readble and machine readable

State of Oregon has [similar procedures](https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/security.aspx),
as does [state of Washington](https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/data-research/election-technology/post-election-audits).
Election denial and efforts to do in person, same day voting
are motivated by something other than desire for secure, reliable voting.

## A Gentle Introduction to Risk-Limiting Audits

The Colorado Secretary of State references a paper,
_A Gentle Introduction to Risk-Limiting Audits_,
by Mark Lindemann and Philip B. Stark,
from [IEEE SECURITY AND PRIVACY](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/aboutJournal.jsp?punumber=8013),
Special Issue on Electronic Voting, 2012

The Coloraod web page links to a [preprint](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/gentle12.pdf)
of the paper, but as is sometimes the case,
the preprint differs significantly from the official, published version.
The preprint provokes confusion around the ballot auditing method,
in that is has some confusion about using percentages or proportions (i.e. 47% vs 0.47).

Get the official version if you can, matey!
